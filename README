Bazylum
===============================================================
Bazylum is a tool which can show you information who long a window
of certain type was active, for example, you will know that you
firefox window for active for, say, 2 hours and pidgin for 1 hour.

Compilation and Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------
To compile bazylum you need x11 and sqlite header files (i.e.
if you're using binary based distro you have to install -dev
packages), and meson build system.

To build it, just type:

	mkdir builddir
	meson builddir
	ninja -C builddir

It should not take a lot of time to build it. When done, you can
install it using:

	ninja -C builddir install

By defaults it installs stuff into /usr/local/bin. You can change
this behavior by defining DESTDIR, e.g.:

	DESTDIR=/path/to/staging/root ninja -C builddir install

Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------
Bazylum consists of two parts: daemon and client. Daemon gathers
information about window activity and writes it to database.
You can start it from ~/.xinitrc for example, like:

	bazylumd

it will fork into background by default. You can start it in
foreground mode as well, just pass '-f' arg:

	bazylumd -f

To obtain actual reports, use 'bazylum' tool. For now it supports
only 'stat' command it looks like this:

(14:44) novel@dirtyvegas:~ %> bazylum stat
urxvt: 9952 sec
Navigator: 3934 sec
gvim: 1818 sec
xv: 1515 sec
pidgin: 121 sec
desktop: 10 sec
Dialog: 6 sec

avg window active time: 25 sec
longest active time: 658 sec
(14:44) novel@dirtyvegas:~ %>

Actually, all information is stored in ~/.bazylum/bazylum.db, so you
can easily generate various reports you need using SQL flexibility.

If you have any ideas, error reports, etc, feel free to drop me
